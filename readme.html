Project Features
---------------------
- Implemented raytracing engine from a starter dart template.
- Handled a variety of primitive object types and lighting factors, including shadows, reflection, and refraction.
- Implemented an MPEG encoder to generate video files

MPEG Video Encoder
===================

I translated an MPEG encoder from C to Dart. Additionally, I added the ability to read images in from a specified directory rather than just from function calls. This process consisted of initial translation, including deriving meaning from certain lines that did not translate nicely into dart, and then hours of debugging the many issues that came from translation and the different behaviours of the languages.

After a last minute bug fix I was finally able to render out a video viewable in VLC. The encoder takes in the image location, video location, frame count, and frame rate. Unfortunately I had to remove my asynchrnous code that could take all readable images of any name, but it was not ordering properly.

I also set up FFMPEG on my computer and rendered our project on that before our encoder was working.

The Result

Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------
Configuration of encoder is hard coded, limiting usefulness to specific situations. Additionally the output is only VLC friendly, not universally viewable.


Execute
---------------------
To run, install dart and run `dart run`
